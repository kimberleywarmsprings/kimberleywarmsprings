      <p>
        Kimberley Warm Springs has been a natural wonder for generations, with warm, clear water bubbling 24/7 from beneath the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Photo 1</strong> (below) was taken in 2023, shortly after a cleanup effort removed a layer of algae that had previously smothered the beautiful, churning sand. For a brief moment, the spring returned to its natural, breathtaking state.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, due to the discovery of a rare snail believed to live on the algae, Parks and Reserves has decided to stop maintaining the natural 27°C temperature year-round. As a result, the spring is now returning to a neglected state.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Photo 2</strong> (below), taken just two weeks ago, shows the current condition of the spring — overrun with algae and barely recognizable.

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-900">Our Message</h2>
      <p>
        Would you travel to see this cesspool, just to protect a snail 🐌? Or would you rather see Mother Nature bubbling away in her full glory, as she has for centuries?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let Parks and Reserves know: this is not what’s advertised online, and it's a disgrace to let such a unique natural site fall into this condition.
