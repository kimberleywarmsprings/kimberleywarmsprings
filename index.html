      <h2>About Kimberley Warm Springs</h2>
      <p>
        Kimberley Warm Springs is a unique geothermal site located in northwest Tasmania. With consistently warm temperatures of around 27Â°C, its bubbling sands and mineral-rich waters have been a wonder of nature for centuries. The spring supports a rare and delicate ecosystem â€” but unfortunately, itâ€™s being left to deteriorate.

      <h2>Visual Evidence</h2>

      <img src="images/photo-1.jpg" alt="Kimberley Warm Springs 2023 - Cleaned">
      <p><strong>Photo 1:</strong> Taken in 2023 shortly after a rare cleanup. The algae was cleared, revealing the naturally churning sands beneath â€” a mesmerizing feature and true marvel of nature.</p>

      <img src="images/photo-2.jpg" alt="Kimberley Warm Springs 2025 - Algae Overgrowth">
      <p><strong>Photo 2:</strong> Taken two weeks ago. Due to the presence of a rare snail that supposedly lives on the algae, Parks and Reserves have chosen to suspend regular maintenance. As a result, the spring is now overtaken by heavy algae growth and murky water.</p>

      <h2>A Personal Plea</h2>
      <p>
        Would you travel to see a stagnant cesspool simply because it contains a rare snail â€” or would you come to witness Mother Nature bubbling away 24/7, as it has done for centuries? 
      </p>
      <p>
        The current condition of Kimberley Warm Springs is not what is presented online. What should be a site of natural beauty and pride is now being left to degrade. We call on Parks and Reserves to act â€” to preserve and maintain this iconic place, not abandon it.
